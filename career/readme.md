You are an active part of onboarding. It's your responsibility to onboard yourself well.

### Leave your old job in the best terms possible

- leaves a favourable impression
- easily you will find job in the future via referral/network from your **current** company
- leaving a mess damages the view of the integrity

To leave well:

- write a todo list
- agree with manager who is going to do what
- this helps them plan even stuff after you leave

### Before you start

> If you want to drop any bad habits, **now it's the time to do it**.

- make a list of things you do at work and you **do actively want to change forever**
- develop an active plan to correct them from day #1
- find old pieces of feedback you received. Any still valid/unaddressed? List them out and make it a priority for your first 30/60/90 days

### 30/60/90 days plan

List of:

- Objectives
- Task
- Achievements

Goals:

- take ownership of your onboarding process
- understand the **real** org chart. Who has the real power in the company? Who is relevant in the decision process?

### 30 days plan (Observe)

Learning and observing.

Goals:

- understand the main goals of the company
- understand how the dept and your role help achieving them
- meeting with other people other than the strict circle of team mates
- ensure people know you and your role
- understand the underlying problems and tensions

What to do:

- Ask questions (see below)
- Meet the team and take notes after you do it
- Take notes: how is the onboarding going? What could be done better from your company's perspective? You will one day need to implement this list and make onboarding better
- Suggest how hiring can be improved, if your hiring process had gaps
- Resist the urge to make too many changes. Identify areas to improve but give yourself time.
- Ask for 1:1s (virtual or real coffees) with as many people you can
- Speak to people. If at the coffee break, introduce yourself.

What to ask:

- what have we done well as a company?
- what have we done done badly historically? Ask for single or recurring examples.
- what do you NOT want me to do?
- what does your best dev/person in the company do?

What to write:

- names
- what they do
- understand **who you do work for** (who is waiting for your work to be done)
- understand the best way to communicate internally

It's a great time to do a SWAT analysis of your new company.

- **S**trength
- **W**eaknesses
- **O**pportunities
- **T**hreats

If not scheduled, ask for a 30 day check-in.

### 60 days plan (settle in)

Start contributing.

Goals:

- people know who I am (even better than the first 30 days)
- I understand my dept goals
- I am making progress
- I am productive
- understand the underlying problems and tensions, even more

What to do:

- now that you have a better perspective, redefine your role. Are there chances out there that you can take?
- get some personal wins, so people start noticing
- **define how other perceive you** (tip: write down how other co-workers perceive you, or how you think they do)
- identify opportunities to do work that you can do or that no-one is doing (volunteer or note them down so you can do later)
- do you need more skills to perform your tasks better? Can you do something to acquire them?

Ask your boss for a review and feedback.

### 90 days plan (start making a long term impact)

Goals:

- I am contributing to the company culture
- I know my place and where I **can** and **want** to go
- I have identified long term goals and projects I can work on
- I am methodical, and **the others see me as such**
- I have started working on addressing the underlying problems and tensions

What to do:

- can you identify opportunities, needs that are **outside your dept** and you can pick or volunteer to do?
- Talk to other dept managers/workers and discover their pain points and needs
- follow up with your previous colleagues and reconnect

Also, define accomplishments (see [Tracking yourself](../management/tracking-you-and-others.md)).
It's a great time to look for **big, ambitious but achievable goals**.

### 1 year plan

- Write down goals, and add them to the calendar whenever possible
- Invite people to join you at meetups. Write in Slack you're going and to write you if they want to join
- At company events, meet people you rarely see or talk to
- Can you create a cross-dept group that does a common activity together?
- Can you improve someone else in the company
- **Follow up**. Nurture relationships, write DMs with links ("I thought you might like this", "Thanks for the coffee, let's do it again next week")

### Preparing for 1 year review

- ask the boss for the format beforehand (it's not a secret!)
- ask co-workers what to expect (is it casual? Have any suggestion?)
- bring your accomplishments, clearly list what you improved
- think about a plan for improvement
