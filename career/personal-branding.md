# Personal branding

## Have a tagline

> I help {who/company} achieve/do by {what}

Examples:

> I am an ok programmer, and my job is to hire other ok programmers and turn them into great ones.
> For instance, ...

> I build web applications and engineering teams. My job is to make them perform better and faster.
> Need help in restructuring your engineering hiring process? Let's talk!

## Introduction pitch

- You can say the tagline and then "For example, ..." so you tell a story.

Or even better, you reverse it.

> Do you remember when X happened and Y then followed?
> That's what I do, I avoid mistakes like this from happening.
