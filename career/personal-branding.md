# Personal branding

- [Marketing yourself](https://www.swyx.io/marketing-yourself/)

## Have a tagline

> I help {who/company} achieve/do by {what}

Examples:

> I am an ok programmer, and my job is to hire other ok programmers and turn them into great ones.
> For instance, ...

> I build web applications and engineering teams. My job is to make them perform better and faster.
> Need help in restructuring your engineering hiring process? Let's talk!

## Introduction pitch

- You can say the tagline and then "For example, ..." so you tell a story.

Or even better, you reverse it.

> Do you remember when X happened and Y then followed?
> That's what I do, I avoid mistakes like this from happening.

- Average is boring. Anything not "average" is a good candidate for your Personal Brand.
- In particular: Diversity is strength. Adversity is strength. Weakness is strength. Nothing is off limits.
- Stay positive: Entertain, Educate, Inspire, Motivate.

Identity + Opinions. Who you are + What you're about.
These are as good as tagging them on Twitter:

- Knitter + Accessibility
- Pianist + State Machines
- Applitools + Test Automation
- Coursera + GraphQL
- Cook + Hiring

Your profile is seen more than your face.
Take it seriously:

- Take a great photo and use it _everywhere_.
- Show your real/professional name if possible.
- Your bio should display your affiliations/current projects.

You Need A Domain:

1. Set up a domain (yourname dot come) that has all your best work
2. Pick a field that you are About. Plant your flag. Put up your personal Bat Signal.

**Picking a Domain**: Connect yourself to something important that you love, that you are also ABSURDLY unsatisfied with.
That love-hate tension can fuel you for years.
Plant a flag on your domain, and say: "This is What I Do".

**Marketing Business Value**: Have at your fingertips all the relevant statistics, data, quotes, and anecdotes for when you solve major product pain points, or contributed a major revenue generating/cost saving feature.
It will come up without warning, and you want to be ready.

## At work

### Brag/Hype document

Have at your fingertips all the relevant statistics, data, quotes, and anecdotes for when you solve major product pain points, or contributed a major revenue generating/cost saving feature. Julia Evans calls this a [Brag Document](). There's a [template attached](./brag-document-template.md) to this repo. You should be able to recite your big wins on demand, and frame it in terms of _What's In It For Them_.

- Set a recurring meeting in your calendar to update your Hype Doc. The more frequently you update your Hype Doc, the more you remember to put down, so doing it once a week is a really good strategy.
- Go through your Hype Doc with your manager about once a quarter. This gives you a chance to identify areas youâ€™re excelling in, and areas to spend more energy well before your next evaluation roles around.

## Status updates

Make Status Updates Awesome. Most people put no effort.
No scheduled status updates? Great - Make Your Own. Management always appreciates this.

- regular updates on tickets (eg. end of day)
- make **recorded demos** and share them.
- do lunch & learns. Set up a 30 minutes optional call where you show one thing you have done and explain it.

Memorable words/catch phrase/motto. Nike spends billions to make sure that every time you think of the words "Just Do It", they come up. You can do that on a smaller scale.
