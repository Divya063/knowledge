> - I am who I think you think I am ([Charles Cooley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Cooley))

If you think I am stupid, that doesn’t necessarily make me stupid. If I believe your opinion is valid, then I will end up behaving in ways which reinforce that opinion. This would mirror the 2nd case (“I am what you think I am”). But if I believe your opinion is invalid, that you are just being difficult or jealous or have it difficult at home, then I will behave rather differently.

If you think people see you as a leader, then you'll probably act like one.
If you think people see you as a naive or immature, then you more likely act like it.

> Hard means worry: if you're not worrying that something you're making will come out badly, or that you won't be able to understand something you're studying, then it isn't hard enough. There has to be suspense. [...] Look for smart people and hard problems. Smart people tend to clump together, and if you can find such a clump, it's probably worthwhile to join it.
