# HTTP

## Headers max size

The HTTP RFC does not specify a maximum header length, but in reality most servers and many firewalls support a limited length. In some instances this depends on the header itself but in many cases there's a check against the length of all header values, so one must make sure not to pass too many informations via headers.

> And in practice the 8000 bytes limit is usually found on headers also.

A server that receives an exceedingly large header will reject the request issuing a 400.

## HTTP requests

### Preflight requests

Preflight requests enable the browser to ask for the serverâ€™s permission before making requests with certain HTTP methods and headers. This permissions model puts the server in charge of how cross-origin requests behave. [source](https://livebook.manning.com/book/cors-in-action/chapter-5/7)
