# Knowledge

All the (un)useful stuff I learn along the way.

[Why this](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge)?

## Stats & homepage

![Knowledge stats page](https://github.com/nobitagit/knowledge/workflows/Knowledge%20stats%20page/badge.svg)

After every commit and every day at 00:00am UTC the statistics of my learnings are automatically aggregated and recalculated.
Some extracts of this are then displayed on the [homepage](https://nobitagit.github.io/knowledge/).

To run the stats locally for the last 90 days, cd into the directory of this repo and run:

```sh
go run _repoUtils/main.go
```

You will need to have Go installed on your machine for that to work.
