# Tracking you and others

Why track yourself:

- observe evolution
- easily view past achievements before regular reviews/annual reviews
- you don't remember everything you did
- your manager won't remember everything you did
- if your manager changes you have stuff to prove you did well

A great way to do this: write a [brag document](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/)
Make it so that you can share it with your manager, and with other peers.

> On some teams at work it’s a team norm to share a brag document with peer reviewers to make it easier for them.

> One nice side effect of having a shared idea that it’s normal/good to maintain a brag document at work is that I sometimes see people encouraging each other to record & celebrate their accomplishments (“hey, you should put that in your brag doc, that was really good!”).

> Remember: don’t forget to explain what the results of you work actually were! It’s often important to go back a few months later and fill in what actually happened after you launched the project.

Why track others:

- if you have a manager, helps giving feedback
- if you're a peer, helps giving feedback
- if you're a manager, helps giving feedback

Provide link to PRs, conversations, any note that can be useful
