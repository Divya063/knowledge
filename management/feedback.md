# Feedback

> We must know what to demand of our employees and how to do it, how to set difficult targets for them and how to give negative feedback.

## How to structure feedback

- for each colleague have a file where you list the most positive traits or actions and the shortcomings, so you can work on solving them
- accept that an employee does something better than you, and admit it in public

## How to give positive feedback

- remember to say thanks (via email, in person, a quick message)

## How to give negative feedback

From [Managing incompetence](https://books.google.de/books?id=2-bjAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=how+to+give+negative+feedback+incompetent&source=bl&ots=e-ORyWEqC0&sig=ACfU3U1TlnaVQgPGmC0-WoY9nYjyPLbARQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjS1Y7Or-vpAhVLTcAKHbVYDuYQ6AEwDXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=how%20to%20give%20negative%20feedback%20incompetent&f=false)

Before you approach an employee with negative feedback, ask yourself:

- is the issue worth correcting?
- who needs to be reprimanded? (is it really the employee or is there another reason for the problem?)
- what is the purpose of the reprimand?

A light warning, a reminder, offering help/pairing, a humorous note are enough to straighten out most mistakes.

If you really need to scold, ensure you clarify the consequences of the error in question.

## When is a good time to give a reprimand

- Sooner rather than later, as close to the fact as possible (so the details are clear), but not so near that there's anger and tension generated from the error itself.
- Never hurry, never get too passionate.
- Reprimand in private, praise in public.
- be factual, provide examples, cite facts
