## Designing a new team: clarify the goals

- Write down the goals **before starting onboarding members**
- Ensure you have team goals
- Ensure you have individual goals
- As a leader you need to align company goals to team's goals

Example:

- **Company goal**: Provide a platform to buy quality food at fair prices
- **Checkout team goals**: Provide a quick, seamless and safe payment experience
- **Data analysis team goals**: Collect insightful data, store it safely and allow anyone in the company to access and consume it to increase every other team's output.

## From long term to short term goals

You start from defining long term goals and from there, you derive short term ones.

Short term goals are usually **sprint goals**

## Hiring for a new team

1. Hire for values - very hard to change a person's values. You want the values to align with the team ones
2. Skills and prospect

## Psychological safety

One of the **most important traits of a HPT**.
It's the climate at work when some feels free to speak up.
People are:

- secure to ask for help
- admit mistakes
- discuss existing problems
- share new ideas
- criticising a project

It's **NOT**:

- being nice
- being soft
- everything is great
- everything will work out
- low ambition

> **Problems** are how we get better every single day

People need to be comfortable in sharing problems, issues and bad results to the management.

- High psychological safety + no accountability = **comfort zone**
- Low psychological safety + high accountability = **anxiety**
- High psychological safety + high accountability = **thriving environment for HPTs**
