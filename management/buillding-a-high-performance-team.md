## Designing a new team: clarify the goals

- Write down the goals **before starting onboarding members**
- Ensure you have team goals
- Ensure you have individual goals
- As a leader you need to align company goals to team's goals

Example:

- **Company goal**: Provide a platform to buy quality food at fair prices
- **Checkout team goals**: Provide a quick, seamless and safe payment experience
- **Data analysis team goals**: Collect insightful data, store it safely and allow anyone in the company to access and consume it to increase every other team's output.

## From long term to short term goals

You start from defining long term goals and from there, you derive short term ones.

Short term goals are usually **sprint goals**

## Hiring for a new team

1. Hire for values - very hard to change a person's values. You want the values to align with the team ones
2. Skills and prospect

## Psychological safety

One of the **most important traits of a HPT**.
It's the climate at work when someone feels free to speak up.

> I have defined psychological safety as the belief that the work environment is safe for interpersonal risk taking
>
> -- Amy Edmonson, "The Fearless Organization: Creating Psychological Safety in the Workplace for Learning, Innovation, and Growth"

People are:

- secure to ask for help
- admit mistakes
- discuss existing problems
- share new ideas
- share learnings
- criticising a project
- raising issues with management, even when these issues come from the managers themselves
- giving feedback to any other colleague

It's **NOT**:

- being nice
- being soft
- everything is great
- everything will work out
- low ambition
- not a personality trait

> **Problems** are how we get better every single day

People need to be comfortable in sharing problems, issues and bad results to the management.

- High psychological safety + no accountability = **comfort zone**
- Low psychological safety + high accountability = **anxiety**
- Low psychological safety + Low accountability = **apathy**
- High psychological safety + high accountability = **thriving environment for HPTs**

It's important to understand that psychological safety can surely be a company-wide metric, but most likely different teams within the same company can score various degrees of PS.

Making mistakes is part of the process, it's fundamental that a team surfaces candidly their mistakes and sets the ground to solving them.

The consequences of high PS:

- the team works to improve
- employees are more engaged

PS is a trait of the team, more than the individual. And it's not due to the chemistry of the people, it's instilled by the leaders. The leaders of a group ensure that this value is embedded in the environment.

## Joining an existing team

When joining, perform a team assessment. Rate based on the 10 characteristics of a HPT:

1. Sense of purpose
2. Shared values
3. Established communication norms
4. Superior leadership
5. Clearly defined and interdependent roles
6. Have complementary skills
7. Continuous learning and knowledge sharing
8. Quality awareness
9. Effective work processes
10. Flexible and adaptable

Once you have highlighted the pain points, which one to prioritise depends on context.

- What needs to change?
- How does success look like?
- Who needs to change and how?

Good to track with OKRs.

### Coaching

Team coaching needs to be continuous and happen at least quarterly.
1:1 coaching should be more frequent.
