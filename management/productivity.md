# Productivity

- The most important thing is to take care your calendar. See [how here](./reamde.md).
- Maintain your own OKRs.
- Automate anything possible.
- Delegate anything possible.
- NEVER multitask. Divide and conquer.
- No notifications, except urgent ones.
- Do the hard things 1st in the day.
