# Conducting interviews

## Choosing a good question

- ask for a problem that can be solved in many incremental steps.

> Some questions have "Aha!" moments.They rest on a particular insight. If the candidate doesn't get that one bit, then they do poorly. If they get it, then suddenly they've outperformed many candidates.
> Even if that insight is an indicator of skills, it's still only one indicator. Ideally, you want a question that has a series of hurdles, insights, or optimizations. Multiple data points beat a single data point.
> Here's a test: if you can give a hint or piece of guidance that makes a substantial difference in a candidate's performance, then it's probably not a good interview question

- be positive and offer encouragement. Use words such as "great point", "this is an interesting approach", "right, exactly".

## Coaching a candidate

> Many candidates don't use an example to solve an interview question (or they don't use a good example).Thismakes it substantially more difficult to develop a solution, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they're not very good problem solvers. If candidates don't write an example themselves, or if they inadvertently write a special case, guide them.

- If they get nervous and stuck and aren't sure where to go, suggest to them that they walk through the brute force solution and look for areas to optimize.
