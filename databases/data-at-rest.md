# Data at rest

## Principles

- **confidentiality**: only show the right data to the right people.
- **integrity**: only authorized parties can change the data, and a record of this change has to be stored.
- **availability**: data must be there when people need it. A DDoS attack is a threat for availability, for example.

## Symmetric key encryption

One key is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data.
