## Trennbare un nicht trennbare Verben

These are verbs that are composed of two parts.
Examples are: einkaufen, unterladen, verbinden, bestellen, besuchen.

**Trennbare** have the first part that can be a standalone word.

> ein_kaufen, mit_nehmen, weg_werefen

**Nicht trennbare** verbs have the first part of the verb that can't live on its own.

> ver_binden, be_stellen

You would never break these verbs when building a sentence.

## The perfect

### When to use "haben" and when to use "sein"

Use sein when there is Bewegung (fahren, gehen, laufen).
Use haben when there is not.

Use haben when a verb supports accussative (chi/che cosa).

The verbs that end in "ieren" (eg, studieren, reparieren) don't get the ge- at the beginning. You say "studiert", not "gestudiert".

If it's a composite verb, it depends if they are **trennbare** verb or not.
Trennbare: `ge` is inserted between the first part and the rest of the verb.

> ein_ge_kauft, weg_ge_worfen
