# Spontaneous speaking

From [Think Fast, Talk Smart: Communication Techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAnw168huqA).

- Anxiety is normal

## Anxiety is normal

- Acknowledge anxiety
- We feel as we are performing

## Reframe as a **conversation** not a performance

- Be **open physically**. Don't distance yourself from the other.
- Start with **questions** (rhetorical, polling, etc.)
- Use **conversational, inclusive language** (instead of “this is important to you” use “one must consider”, avid “step 1, step 2, step 3” use “The first thing for you to consider..”)
- Warm up your voice

## Practice Steps to Speak Spontaneously

- It's ok to be average. Don't try to overdo.
- Turn the conversation into an opportunity and not a challenge. If it's asked to you to speak, say "yes, thanks".

## Smile when you enter a room

## Start with a compliment

## Ask why

Asking why is a great way of going out of the usual path of a conversation

- "I work as a lawyer" => Why did you start that?
- Why did you apply to our company?

## Make the other people feel at ease

## Have the first thing you want to say ready
