## Short variable declaration (or the walrus operator)

```go

title := "Mr." // illegal

func main() {
  name := "John Green" // ok
}
```

- It can be used only inside functions. Every top level declaration need to **start with a keyword like var, const, func, type, and import**.
- Can't be used twice (no redeclare)
- Can be re-assigned though:

```go
name := "Tom"
name = "Nelson" // all fine, we're just reassigning a new value
name := "Gary" // error, we're redeclaring a new variable
```

While using the **var keyword** allows one to initialise the variable at a later stage after declaration, when using `:=` we are forced to initialise it with a value.
This means that the value/expression on the right will be used to infer the type, so we can leave it out.

It can be used to declare multiple variables all at once:

```go
person1, person2, person3 := 'Anthony', 'Jules', 'Hattie' // same type
person, age, isDev := 'Kyle', 23, false // different types
```

## Pointers

Read [this article](https://medium.com/rungo/pointers-in-go-a789eafccd53).
When you are declaring a variable, the Go compiler will allocate some memory for it in the RAM and depending on its type, it will allocate a specific size of memory to store the data.
That memory will have some **memory address** so that go can find that variableâ€™s value when asked for it. These memory addresses are represented in hexadecimal values.

```sh
0x40e020
```

A pointer is a variable which points to the memory location of another variable.

```go
func main() {
	var x *int
	fmt.Printf("Type: %T\nValue: %v", x, x)
}
// Type: *int
// Value: <nil>
```

An un-initialised pointer does not refer to any point in memory, a we saw above.

```go
func main() {
  x := 6
  var px *int
  px = &x
	fmt.Printf("Type: %T\nValue: %v", px, px)
}
// Type: *int
// Value: 0x40e020
```

To access an **address in memory** of a variable, Go provides the **& operator** (ampersand) which is used in front of the variable name, and returns the memory address.
To access the **value** of a pointer, Go provides the **\* operator**. This is called **dereferencing**.

```go
func main() {
  x := 6
  var px *int
  px = &x
	fmt.Printf("Type: %T\nValue: %v", px, *px)
}
// Type: *int
// Value: 6
```

We can also change the value of that pointer. This is interesting:

```go
func main() {
  x := 6
  px := &x // px points the same memory location of x
  *px = 7 // we change the value of THAT SAME location
  fmt.Printf("x is %v\n", x) // x is 7 (!!!)
  fmt.Printf("the memory location %v holds the value %v\n", px, *px)
  // the memory location 0x40e020 holds the value 7
}
```

## Concurrency in Go

You might want to refresh [concurrency, parallelism and threads](../general-programming/README.MD#Concurrency) or check [this article](https://medium.com/rungo/achieving-concurrency-in-go-3f84cbf870ca).

Traditional OOP languages like Java have a Thread class that provides the functionality of creating multiple threads in the same process.
Go doesn't have that, but it provides **goroutines**.

Goroutines behave like threads, but they are **an abstraction over threads**.
A Go program creates a few threads. A thread will be executing a goroutine, and if that is blocked, another goroutine will take over and run on that thread.
This behaviour is comparable to the [Thread scheduling](../general-programming/README.MD#Concurrency#Thread&scheduling), but it's faster.

The suggestion is to run the goroutines on one core, and that's the default. If one wants to use more cores it is possible by setting an env variable, but it has to be noted that using multiple cores might be slower than only one. At any given time only one thread per core is allowed to run.

For a comparison of thread vs goroutines read [this great table](https://medium.com/rungo/achieving-concurrency-in-go-3f84cbf870ca), under the section "Threads vs Goroutines\*\* or [this gist](https://gist.github.com/thatisuday/1a357a725113e1c1cdf174a537287afd#file-threasvsgoroutines-md).
